# Smart Cloud App - Complete Implementation Plan ✅

## Current Goal
Build a complete university file management system with role-based authentication, file uploads, and dashboards for students, professors, and admins.

---

## Phase 1: Authentication System with Database ✅
- [x] Set up SQLite database with users table
- [x] Create database module with user CRUD operations
- [x] Add password hashing with bcrypt
- [x] Test database operations (student and professor creation verified)
- [x] Create landing page with role selection (طالب/أستاذ/مشرف)
- [x] Build login forms for each role with appropriate fields
- [x] Build registration forms for students and teachers
- [x] Hard-code admin credentials (username: admin, password: admin123)
- [x] Implement authentication state management and session handling
- [x] Test all authentication flows (login, registration, password verification)

**Status**: ✅ Complete - All authentication working with database integration

## Phase 2: File Upload System
- [ ] Create SQLite tables for files, courses, and academic years
- [ ] Implement professor file upload UI (Homework + Lecture Files)
- [ ] Add file storage system (save to local uploads/ directory)
- [ ] Connect uploads to database with metadata (filename, uploader, date, course, academic year)
- [ ] Add file type validation (PDF, DOCX, PPT, etc.)
- [ ] Implement file listing and download functionality

---

## Phase 3: Enhanced Dashboards
- [ ] Redesign student dashboard with file access by course
- [ ] Add file browsing and download for students
- [ ] Enhance professor dashboard with uploaded files list
- [ ] Update admin dashboard with user management and system stats
- [ ] Add file management features for admin (view all, delete)

## Notes
- ✅ Admin credentials: username="admin", password="admin123" (hard-coded and working)
- ✅ Student registration: Name, University ID, Email, Password
- ✅ Teacher registration: Name, Username, Email, Password
- ✅ Database tested with bcrypt password hashing working perfectly
- 📁 Next: Implement file upload system with SQLite metadata
- Files will be stored in local uploads/ directory + SQLite metadata
- Arabic RTL interface throughout
